# AutoPC
This is a project I designed to help with automating actions on my PC in a more human manner. Instead of trying to accessesing the innerworkings of webpages or other programs to get data or automate tasks, this toolset allows you to automate based off of the visuals on screen and the inputs of the mouse and keyboard.

For an example of how I would typically use this project to get data from web applications, see my [AutoPC Demo](https://github.com/kenny2892/AutoPcDemo) project.
